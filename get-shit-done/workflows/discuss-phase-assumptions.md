<purpose>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — using codebase-first analysis
and assumption surfacing instead of interview-style questioning.

You are a thinking partner, not an interviewer. Analyze the codebase deeply, surface what you
believe based on evidence, and ask the user only to correct what's wrong.
</purpose>

<available_agent_types>
Valid GSD subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- gsdr-assumptions-analyzer — Analyzes codebase to surface implementation assumptions
</available_agent_types>

<downstream_awareness>
**CONTEXT.md feeds into:**

1. **gsdr-phase-researcher** — Reads CONTEXT.md to know WHAT to research
2. **gsdr-planner** — Reads CONTEXT.md to know WHAT decisions are locked

**Your job:** Capture decisions clearly enough that downstream agents can act on them
without asking the user again. Output uses the fork's typed-claim CONTEXT.md format
(see `get-shit-done/references/claim-types.md`); the upstream 6-section set is preserved
as a subset within it (see NARROWING DECISION comments above).
</downstream_awareness>

<philosophy>
**Assumptions mode philosophy:**

The user is a visionary, not a codebase archaeologist. They need enough context to evaluate
whether your assumptions match their intent — not to answer questions you could figure out
by reading the code.

- Read the codebase FIRST, form opinions SECOND, ask ONLY about what's genuinely unclear
- Every assumption must cite evidence (file paths, patterns found)
- Every assumption must state consequences if wrong
- Minimize user interactions: ~2-4 corrections vs ~15-20 questions
</philosophy>

<scope_guardrail>
**CRITICAL: No scope creep.**

The phase boundary comes from ROADMAP.md and is FIXED. Discussion clarifies HOW to implement
what's scoped, never WHETHER to add new capabilities.

When user suggests scope creep:
"[Feature X] would be a new capability — that's its own phase.
Want me to note it for the roadmap backlog? For now, let's focus on [phase domain]."

Capture the idea in "Deferred Ideas". Don't lose it, don't act on it.
</scope_guardrail>

<answer_validation>
**IMPORTANT: Answer validation** — After every AskUserQuestion call, check if the response
is empty or whitespace-only. If so:
1. Retry the question once with the same parameters
2. If still empty, present the options as a plain-text numbered list

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):**
When text mode is active, do not use AskUserQuestion at all. Present every question as a
plain-text numbered list and ask the user to type their choice number. See
`docs/workflow-discuss-mode.md` §3 for full text_mode semantics.
</answer_validation>

<confidence_badge_mapping>
**Confidence badges → fork typed-claim vocabulary.**

The analyzer agent returns assumptions with upstream-compatible confidence badges
(`Confident` / `Likely` / `Unclear`). When writing CONTEXT.md in the fork's typed-claim
format, map these to typed claims per `docs/workflow-discuss-mode.md` §4:

| Upstream badge | Fork typed-claim |
|---|---|
| Confident | `[decided:cited]` or `[evidenced:cited]` |
| Likely | `[assumed:reasoned]` |
| Unclear | `[open]` (tracked in `<questions>`) |

This preserves upstream's analyzer prompt verbatim (so it returns what upstream expects)
while yielding fork-compatible typed-claim CONTEXT.md.
</confidence_badge_mapping>

Exit workflow.

**If `phase_found` is true:** Continue to preflight_analyzer_check.

**Preflight analyzer availability check (GATE-08b spawn point 1 of 3):**

Before continuing, verify that the `gsdr-assumptions-analyzer` agent can be dispatched in the
current runtime. This is a lightweight preflight that runs a minimal analyzer invocation
scoped to "list available tools only" so we fail-fast if the agent is missing from the
installed agent surface rather than discovering the failure mid-workflow.

If the preflight returns anything other than `AVAILABLE:`, display: "Analyzer agent not

reduced-fidelity inline inference for subsequent steps. Do NOT exit.

**Auto mode** — If `--auto` is present in ARGUMENTS:
- In `check_existing`: auto-select "Update it" (if context exists) or continue without prompting
- In `present_assumptions`: skip confirmation gate, proceed directly to write CONTEXT.md
- In `correct_assumptions`: auto-select recommended option for each correction
- Log each auto-selected choice inline
- After completion, auto-advance to plan-phase
</step>

<step name="check_existing">
Check if CONTEXT.md already exists using `has_context` from init.

```bash
ls ${phase_dir}/*-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If exists:**

**If `--auto`:** Auto-select "Update it". Log: `[auto] Context exists — updating with assumption-based analysis.`

**Otherwise:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Context"
- question: "Phase [X] already has context. What do you want to do?"
- options:
  - "Update it" — Re-analyze codebase and refresh assumptions
  - "View it" — Show me what's there
  - "Skip" — Use existing context as-is

If "Update": Load existing, continue to load_prior_context
If "View": Display CONTEXT.md, then offer update/skip
If "Skip": Exit workflow

**If doesn't exist:**

Check `has_plans` and `plan_count` from init. **If `has_plans` is true:**

**If `--auto`:** Auto-select "Continue and replan after". Log: `[auto] Plans exist — continuing with assumption analysis, will replan after.`

**Otherwise:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Plans exist"
- question: "Phase [X] already has {plan_count} plan(s) created without user context. Your decisions here won't affect existing plans unless you replan."
- options:
  - "Continue and replan after"
  - "View existing plans"
  - "Cancel"

If "Continue and replan after": Continue to load_prior_context.
If "View existing plans": Display plan files, then offer "Continue" / "Cancel".
If "Cancel": Exit workflow.

**If `has_plans` is false:** Continue to load_prior_context.
</step>

<step name="load_prior_context">
Read project-level and prior phase context to avoid re-asking decided questions.

**Step 1: Read project-level files**
```bash
cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Extract from these:
- **PROJECT.md** — Vision, principles, non-negotiables, user preferences
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** — Acceptance criteria, constraints
- **STATE.md** — Current progress, any flags

**Step 2: Read all prior CONTEXT.md files**
```bash
(find .planning/phases -name "*-CONTEXT.md" 2>/dev/null || true) | sort
```

For each CONTEXT.md where phase number < current phase:
- Read the `<decisions>` section AND (if present) `<working_model>`, `<constraints>`,
  `<guardrails>`, `<dependencies>` — these are locked preferences and governing claims
  under the fork's typed-claim contract
- Read `<specifics>` — particular references or "I want it like X" moments
- Note patterns (e.g., "user consistently prefers minimal UI")

**Step 3: Build internal `<prior_decisions>` context**

Structure the extracted information for use in assumption generation.

**If no prior context exists:** Continue without — expected for early phases.
</step>

<step name="cross_reference_todos">
Check if any pending todos are relevant to this phase's scope.

```bash
TODO_MATCHES=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" todo match-phase "${PHASE_NUMBER}" 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse JSON for: `todo_count`, `matches[]`.

**If `todo_count` is 0:** Skip silently.

**If matches found:** Present matched todos, use AskUserQuestion (multiSelect) to fold relevant ones into scope.

**For selected (folded) todos:** Store as `<folded_todos>` for CONTEXT.md `<decisions>` section.
**For unselected:** Store as `<reviewed_todos>` for CONTEXT.md `<deferred>` section.

**Auto mode (`--auto`):** Fold all todos with score >= 0.4 automatically. Log the selection.
</step>

<step name="load_methodology">
Read the project-level methodology file if it exists. This must happen before assumption analysis
so that active lenses shape how assumptions are generated and evaluated.

```bash
cat .planning/METHODOLOGY.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If METHODOLOGY.md exists:**
- Parse each named lens: its diagnoses, recommendations, and triggering conditions
- Store as internal `<active_lenses>` for use in deep_codebase_analysis and present_assumptions
- When spawning the gsdr-assumptions-analyzer, pass the lens list so it can flag which lenses apply
- When presenting assumptions, append a "Methodology" section showing which lenses were applied
  and what they flagged (if anything)

**If METHODOLOGY.md does not exist:** Skip silently. This artifact is optional.
</step>

<step name="scout_codebase">
Lightweight scan of existing code to inform assumption generation.

**Step 1: Check for existing codebase maps**
```bash
ls .planning/codebase/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

**If codebase maps exist:** Read relevant ones (CONVENTIONS.md, STRUCTURE.md, STACK.md). Extract reusable components, patterns, integration points. Skip to Step 3.

**Step 2: If no codebase maps, do targeted grep**

Extract key terms from phase goal, search for related files.

```bash
grep -rl "{term1}\|{term2}" src/ app/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Read the 3-5 most relevant files.

**Step 3: Build internal `<codebase_context>`**

Identify reusable assets, established patterns, integration points, and creative options. Store internally for use in deep_codebase_analysis.
</step>

<step name="deep_codebase_analysis">
Spawn a `gsdr-assumptions-analyzer` agent to deeply analyze the codebase for this phase. This
keeps raw file contents out of the main context window, protecting token budget.

**Resolve calibration tier (per NARROWING DECISION category d — resolve from `model_profile`):**

Per Plan 03 delta §3(d), the fork does NOT adopt USER-PROFILE.md. The analyzer-agent output
shape still uses upstream's three tiers (`full_maturity` / `standard` / `minimal_decisive`),
but the tier is resolved from the shipped `model_profile` (`config.json:5`).

```bash
MODEL_PROFILE=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get model_profile 2>/dev/null || echo "balanced")
```

Map `model_profile` to calibration tier:
- `quality` → `full_maturity` (more alternatives, detailed evidence)
- `balanced` or `adaptive` → `standard` (default)
- `budget` or `cost` or `fast` → `minimal_decisive` (decisive single recommendations)

If `model_profile` is unset or unrecognized: `calibration_tier = "standard"`.

is the "If wrong" consequence:

Use AskUserQuestion (multiSelect):
- header: "Corrections"
- question: "Which assumptions need correcting?"
- options: [one per assumption, label = assumption statement, description = "If wrong: {consequence}"]

For each selected correction, ask ONE focused question:

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "{Area Name}"
- question: "What should we do instead for: {assumption statement}?"
- options: [2-3 concrete alternatives describing user-visible outcomes, recommended option first]

Record each correction:
- Original assumption
- User's chosen alternative
- Reason (if provided via "Other" free text)

After all corrections processed, continue to write_context with updated assumptions.

**Auto mode:** Should not reach this step (--auto skips from present_assumptions).
</step>

<step name="write_context">
Create phase directory if needed. Write CONTEXT.md using the fork's typed-claim contract.

**File:** `${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md`

**Section contract** (per NARROWING DECISION category e — fork superset preserved):

The fork's CONTEXT.md uses a richer section set than upstream's 6-section flat format.
Fork sections include: `<domain>`, `<working_model>`, `<constraints>`, `<guardrails>`,
`<questions>`, `<dependencies>`, `<canonical_refs>`, `<code_context>`, `<specifics>`,
`<deferred>`, plus Acceptance Tests appendix where relevant. Entries are typed per
`get-shit-done/references/claim-types.md` with `[decided:*]`, `[assumed:*]`,
`[governing:*]`, `[open]`, `[projected:*]`, `[evidenced:*]`, `[stipulated:*]` markers.

Upstream's 6 sections map into fork's typed sections:
- upstream `<domain>` → fork `<domain>`
- upstream `<decisions>` → fork `<working_model>` + typed `[decided:*]` claims
- upstream `<canonical_refs>` → fork `<canonical_refs>`
- upstream `<code_context>` → fork `<code_context>`
- upstream `<specifics>` → fork `<specifics>`
- upstream `<deferred>` → fork `<deferred>`

Map analyzer output to CONTEXT.md sections (per confidence_badge_mapping above):
- `Confident` assumptions → `[decided:cited]` / `[evidenced:cited]` claims under
  `<working_model>` or `<decisions>` (D-01, D-02, etc.)
- `Likely` assumptions → `[assumed:reasoned]` claims with alternatives documented
- `Unclear` assumptions → `[open]` claims tracked in `<questions>`
- User corrections → override the original assumption
- Folded todos → `<decisions>` under "### Folded Todos"

```markdown
# Phase {PHASE}: {phase_name} - Context

**Gathered:** {date} (assumptions mode)
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

{Domain boundary from ROADMAP.md — clear statement of scope anchor}
</domain>

<working_model>
## Working Model

{High-level approach derived from Confident/Likely assumptions. Typed claims
with [decided:*] / [assumed:*] / [evidenced:*] markers per claim-types.md.}
</working_model>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### {Area Name 1}
- **D-01:** [decided:cited] {Decision — from Confident assumption or correction}
- **D-02:** [decided:reasoned] {Decision}

### {Area Name 2}
- **D-03:** [assumed:reasoned] {Decision with Likely confidence}

### Claude's Discretion
{Any assumptions where the user confirmed "you decide" or left as-is with Likely confidence}

### Folded Todos
{If any todos were folded into scope}
</decisions>

<constraints>
## Constraints

{[governing:cited] / [governing:reasoned] — hard boundaries from PROJECT.md,
REQUIREMENTS.md, active methodology lenses. If none: "No constraints surfaced
by analyzer — phase operates within project defaults."}
</constraints>

<guardrails>
## Guardrails

{Per-phase anti-patterns or scope risks surfaced by analyzer / methodology lenses.
If none: "No guardrails flagged — analyzer did not surface scope risks in this pass."}
</guardrails>

<questions>
## Open Questions

{[open] claims from Unclear assumptions — tracked here for planner/researcher
attention. If none: "No open questions — all assumptions reached Confident or Likely."}
</questions>

<dependencies>
## Dependencies

{Claim-dependency edges: which D-N depends on which prior-phase decision or
current-phase claim. If none: "No cross-claim dependencies surfaced."}
</dependencies>

<canonical_refs>
## Canonical References

**Downstream agents MUST read these before planning or implementing.**

{Accumulated canonical refs from analyze step — full relative paths}

[If no external specs: "No external specs — requirements fully captured in decisions above"]
</canonical_refs>

<code_context>
## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
{From codebase scout + Explore subagent findings}

### Established Patterns
{Patterns that constrain/enable this phase}

### Integration Points
{Where new code connects to existing system}
</code_context>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

{Any particular references from corrections or user input}

[If none: "No specific requirements — open to standard approaches"]
</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

{Ideas mentioned during corrections that are out of scope}

### Reviewed Todos (not folded)
{Todos reviewed but not folded — with reason}

[If none: "None — analysis stayed within phase scope"]
</deferred>

<step name="auto_advance">
Check for auto-advance trigger:

1. Parse `--auto` flag from $ARGUMENTS
2. Sync chain flag:

3. Read chain flag and user preference:
   ```bash
   AUTO_CHAIN=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow._auto_chain_active 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   AUTO_CFG=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
