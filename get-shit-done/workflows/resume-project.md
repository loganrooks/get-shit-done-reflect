<trigger>
Use this workflow when:
- Starting a new session on an existing project
- User says "continue", "what's next", "where were we", "resume"
- Any planning operation when .planning/ already exists
- User returns after time away from project
</trigger>

<purpose>
Instantly restore full project context so "Where were we?" has an immediate, complete answer.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="initialize">
Load all context in one call:

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs init resume)
```

Parse JSON for: `state_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `project_exists`, `planning_exists`, `has_interrupted_agent`, `interrupted_agent_id`, `commit_docs`, `dual_install`.

**If `state_exists` is true:** Proceed to load_state
**If `state_exists` is false but `roadmap_exists` or `project_exists` is true:** Offer to reconstruct STATE.md
**If `planning_exists` is false:** This is a new project - route to /gsd:new-project
</step>

<step name="detect_runtime">
Detect which runtime this workflow is executing in by examining the path prefix
used in this file. The installer replaces ~/.claude/ with the target runtime's
path prefix during installation.

Runtime detection from path prefix:
- ~/.claude/ paths -> Claude Code (command prefix: /gsd:)
- ~/.config/opencode/ paths -> OpenCode (command prefix: /gsd-)
- ~/.gemini/ paths -> Gemini CLI (command prefix: /gsd:)
- ~/.codex/ paths -> Codex CLI (command prefix: $gsd-)

Store the detected command prefix for use when rendering command suggestions.
For example, if this file contains ~/.codex/ paths, the command prefix is $gsd-
and "plan-phase 3" renders as "$gsd-plan-phase 3".
</step>

<step name="load_state">

Read and parse STATE.md, then PROJECT.md:

```bash
cat .planning/STATE.md
cat .planning/PROJECT.md
```

**From STATE.md extract:**

- **Project Reference**: Core value and current focus
- **Current Position**: Phase X of Y, Plan A of B, Status
- **Progress**: Visual progress bar
- **Recent Decisions**: Key decisions affecting current work
- **Pending Todos**: Ideas captured during sessions
- **Blockers/Concerns**: Issues carried forward
- **Session Continuity**: Where we left off, any resume files

**From PROJECT.md extract:**

- **What This Is**: Current accurate description
- **Requirements**: Validated, Active, Out of Scope
- **Key Decisions**: Full decision log with outcomes
- **Constraints**: Hard limits on implementation

</step>

<step name="check_incomplete_work">
Look for incomplete work that needs attention:

```bash
# Check for structured handoff (preferred — machine-readable)
cat .planning/HANDOFF.json 2>/dev/null || true

# Check for phase-level handoffs (mid-plan resumption)
ls .planning/phases/*/.continue-here*.md 2>/dev/null || true

# Check for project-level handoffs (not tied to a specific phase)
ls .planning/.continue-here.md 2>/dev/null || true

# Check for plans without summaries (incomplete execution)
for plan in .planning/phases/*/*-PLAN.md; do
  [ -e "$plan" ] || continue
  summary="${plan/PLAN/SUMMARY}"
  [ ! -f "$summary" ] && echo "Incomplete: $plan"
done 2>/dev/null || true

# Check for interrupted agents (use has_interrupted_agent and interrupted_agent_id from init)
if [ "$has_interrupted_agent" = "true" ]; then
  echo "Interrupted agent: $interrupted_agent_id"
fi
```

**If .continue-here file exists:**

- This is a mid-plan resumption point
- Read the file for specific resumption context
- If <next_action> contains /gsd: or $gsd- command syntax (old format),
  display it as-is -- it may not match the current runtime but provides
  useful context. New-format files have semantic-only next_action.
- Flag: "Found mid-plan checkpoint"

**Note:** The .continue-here.md file contains semantic state only (no command
syntax). When presenting resumption options, render commands using the detected
runtime prefix from detect_runtime step.

**If PLAN without SUMMARY exists:**

- Execution was started but not completed
- Flag: "Found incomplete plan execution"

**If interrupted agent found:**

- Subagent was spawned but session ended before completion
- Read agent-history.json for task details
- Flag: "Found interrupted agent"

**After loading .continue-here context, delete the file:**

```bash
# Delete the loaded handoff file (phase-level or project-level)
rm -f "$CONTINUE_HERE_PATH"
```

The handoff context is now loaded into this session. The file is stale.
The continue-here template contract states: "This file gets DELETED after resume -- it's not permanent storage."
If the session ends unexpectedly before work completes, the user can re-create
a handoff with /gsd:pause-work.
</step>

<step name="present_status">
Present complete project status to user:

[If dual_install.detected is true (from init JSON):]
ℹ️  Dual GSD installation detected:
    Local: v[dual_install.local.version] (this project — active)
    Global: v[dual_install.global.version] (baseline)
    See: references/dual-installation.md

[If incomplete work found:]
⚠️  Incomplete work detected:
    - [.continue-here file or incomplete plan]

[If interrupted agent found:]
⚠️  Interrupted agent detected:
    Agent ID: [id]
    Task: [task description from agent-history.json]
    Interrupted: [timestamp]

    Resume with: Task tool (resume parameter with agent ID)

</step>

<step name="determine_next_action">
Based on project state, determine the most logical next action:

**If interrupted agent exists:**
→ Primary: Resume interrupted agent (Task tool with resume parameter)
→ Option: Start fresh (abandon agent work)

**If .continue-here file exists:**
→ Primary: Resume from checkpoint
→ Option: Start fresh on current plan

**If incomplete plan (PLAN without SUMMARY):**
→ Primary: Complete the incomplete plan
→ Option: Abandon and move on

**If phase in progress, all plans complete:**
→ Primary: Transition to next phase
→ Option: Review completed work

**If phase ready to plan:**
→ Check if CONTEXT.md exists for this phase:

- If CONTEXT.md missing:
  → Primary: Discuss phase vision (how user imagines it working)
  → Secondary: Plan directly (skip context gathering)
- If CONTEXT.md exists:
  → Primary: Plan the phase
  → Option: Review roadmap

**If phase ready to execute:**
→ Primary: Execute next plan
→ Option: Review the plan first
</step>

<step name="offer_options">
**Command rendering:** When presenting command suggestions below, use the
command prefix detected in the detect_runtime step. All /gsd: references
in the examples below are SOURCE-format placeholders -- the installer
transforms them to the correct prefix for the installed runtime. When
displaying commands to the user (especially from .continue-here.md semantic
state), construct the command using the detected prefix.

Present contextual options based on project state:

```
What would you like to do?

[Primary action based on state - e.g.:]
1. Resume interrupted agent [if interrupted agent found]
   OR
1. Execute phase (/gsd:execute-phase {phase})
   OR
1. Discuss Phase 3 context (/gsd:discuss-phase 3) [if CONTEXT.md missing]
   OR
1. Plan Phase 3 (/gsd:plan-phase 3) [if CONTEXT.md exists or discuss option declined]

[Secondary options:]
2. Review current phase status
3. Check pending todos ([N] pending)
4. Review brief alignment
5. Something else
```

**Note:** When offering phase planning, check for CONTEXT.md existence first:

```bash
ls .planning/phases/XX-name/*-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

If missing, suggest discuss-phase before plan. If exists, offer plan directly.

Wait for user selection.
</step>

<step name="route_to_workflow">
**Note:** The command references below (e.g., /gsd:execute-phase) are in source
format. When this file is installed to a runtime, the installer transforms them
to the correct syntax. No additional runtime adaptation needed in this step.

Based on user selection, route to appropriate workflow:

- **Execute plan** → Show command for user to run after clearing:
  ```
  ---

  ## ▶ Next Up

  **{phase}-{plan}: [Plan Name]** — [objective from PLAN.md]

  `/gsd:execute-phase {phase}`

  <sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

  ---
  ```
- **Plan phase** → Show command for user to run after clearing:
  ```
  ---

  ## ▶ Next Up

  **Phase [N]: [Name]** — [Goal from ROADMAP.md]

  `/gsd:plan-phase [phase-number]`

  <sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

  ---

  **Also available:**
  - `/gsd:discuss-phase [N]` — gather context first
  - `/gsd:research-phase [N]` — investigate unknowns

  ---
  ```
- **Transition** → ./transition.md
- **Check todos** → Read .planning/todos/pending/, present summary
- **Review alignment** → Read PROJECT.md, compare to current state
- **Something else** → Ask what they need
</step>

<step name="update_session">
Before proceeding to routed workflow, update session continuity:

Update STATE.md:

```markdown
## Session Continuity

Last session: [now]
Stopped at: Session resumed, proceeding to [action]
Resume file: [updated if applicable]
```

This ensures if session ends unexpectedly, next resume knows the state.
</step>

</process>

<reconstruction>
If STATE.md is missing but other artifacts exist:

"STATE.md missing. Reconstructing from artifacts..."

1. Read PROJECT.md → Extract "What This Is" and Core Value
2. Read ROADMAP.md → Determine phases, find current position
3. Scan \*-SUMMARY.md files → Extract decisions, concerns
4. Count pending todos in .planning/todos/pending/
5. Check for .continue-here files → Session continuity

Reconstruct and write STATE.md, then proceed normally.

This handles cases where:

- Project predates STATE.md introduction
- File was accidentally deleted
- Cloning repo without full .planning/ state
  </reconstruction>

<quick_resume>
If user says "continue" or "go":
- Load state silently
- Determine primary action
- Execute immediately without presenting options

"Continuing from [state]... [action]"
</quick_resume>

<success_criteria>
Resume is complete when:

- [ ] STATE.md loaded (or reconstructed)
- [ ] Incomplete work detected and flagged
- [ ] Clear status presented to user
- [ ] Contextual next actions offered
- [ ] User knows exactly where project stands
- [ ] Session continuity updated
      </success_criteria>
