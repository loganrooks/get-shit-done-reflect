<objective>
Collect signals from a completed phase's execution artifacts.

After running `/gsd:execute-phase`, run this command to analyze what happened — detect deviations from plans, debugging struggles, and configuration mismatches. Qualifying signals are persisted to the knowledge base for future surfacing.

This is a retrospective analysis pass. It reads artifacts without modifying them.

<process>
1. **Parse phase number** from arguments
2. **Delegate to workflow** at `get-shit-done/workflows/collect-signals.md` -- workflow reads sensor config, spawns enabled sensors in parallel (artifact sensor, git sensor), collects their output, and passes to the signal synthesizer for deduplication, rigor enforcement, and KB persistence
3. **Report completion** with signal counts and files written
