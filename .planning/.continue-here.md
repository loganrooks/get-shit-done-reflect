<current_state>
v1.14.1 published to npm. PR #4 merged. On branch `main`. Between milestones — v1.15 candidate exists but not yet started.
Two items queued before starting v1.15 milestone.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Fixed 6 critical bugs from PR #4 review (C1-C6) via quick-3
- Merged PR #4 to main
- Bumped package.json to 1.14.1, updated CHANGELOG
- Tagged v1.14.1, created GitHub Release, npm publish succeeded (1.14.1 live)
- Fixed CHANGELOG path leak that broke multi-runtime test
- Changed signal cap from per-phase/10 to per-project/100 (4 files updated)
- Logged signal: stale .continue-here files not cleaned up
- Added Pillar 4 (Self-Review & Signal Enrichment) to v1.15 candidate
  - PR code reviewer as `/gsd:review-pr` command + `gsd-reviewer` agent
  - Review findings → signals pipeline
  - Future signal source exploration (backlog)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Task 1: Create `/gsd:release` command (quick fix)
User chose option 2: a separate `/gsd:release` command decoupled from milestone completion.
Purpose: automates version bump + changelog + tag + GitHub Release (which triggers npm publish).
This avoids the messy manual process we just went through (moved tag 3 times, recreated release twice).
Should be a quick task — thin orchestrator command + simple workflow.

## Task 2: Fix remaining critical issues from PR #4 review (C7-C10)
User recalls there were 10 critical issues total, not just 6. We fixed C1-C6 and deferred C7-C10 (test quality).
The PR #4 review comment is at: https://github.com/loganrooks/get-shit-done-reflect/pull/4
C7-C10 were test quality issues:
- C7: Self-fulfilling tests (tests that pass by definition)
- C8: Scaffolding tests inflating test count
- C9-C10: (need to re-read PR review to confirm exact items)
These were originally deferred to v1.15 but user wants them as quick fixes now.

## After those: start v1.15
- v1.15 candidate at `.planning/milestones/v1.15-CANDIDATE.md`
- 5 pillars: MCP Server, Token Observability, Workflow Efficiency, Self-Review & Signal Enrichment, Reliability & Quality
- Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to begin
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- v1.14.1 (not v1.14.0) published — v1.14.0 tag points to pre-fix code, v1.14.1 includes all 6 critical fixes
- Signal cap: per-project/100 replaces per-phase/10
- PR code reviewer will be command (`/gsd:review-pr`) + agent (`gsd-reviewer`) pattern
- `/gsd:release` command chosen over building release into `/gsd:complete-milestone` — decoupled so it can handle patch releases too
- Release automation approach: `/gsd:release` handles version bump + changelog + tag + GitHub Release creation; `publish.yml` already handles npm publish on release event
- The messy release process (tag moved 3x, release recreated 2x, CHANGELOG path leak) should be captured as a signal
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — clean state on main, npm published, ready for next work.
</blockers>

<context>
Branch: main (up to date with origin)
npm: get-shit-done-reflect-cc@1.14.1 published
v1.14.0 tag: points to b0fac0d (pre-fix code, DO NOT use for releases)
v1.14.1 tag: points to 42bbf4b (correct, matches published npm)
PR #4: MERGED
CI: green on main

The release process exposed a workflow gap: `/gsd:complete-milestone` tags before PR review/merge,
leading to tags on buggy code. The `/gsd:release` command will fix this by making release a deliberate
post-merge action.

publish.yml already has a safety check: verifies package.json version matches tag before npm publish.
This caught the mismatch when we first tried (tag on commit with wrong version in package.json).

<next_action>
1. `/clear` for fresh context
2. `/gsd:resume-work` to reload state
3. Create `/gsd:release` command as quick fix
4. Re-read PR #4 review comment to identify C7-C10, fix as quick task
5. Log signal about the messy release process
6. Then `/gsd:new-milestone` for v1.15
</next_action>
