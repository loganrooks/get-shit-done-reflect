<current_state>
v1.14.2 published to npm. All pre-v1.15 tasks complete. On branch `main`. Ready for `/gsd:new-milestone`.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Fixed 6 critical bugs from PR #4 review (C1-C6) via quick-3
- Merged PR #4 to main
- Bumped package.json to 1.14.1, updated CHANGELOG
- Tagged v1.14.1, created GitHub Release, npm publish succeeded (1.14.1 live)
- Fixed CHANGELOG path leak that broke multi-runtime test
- Changed signal cap from per-phase/10 to per-project/100 (4 files updated)
- Logged signal: stale .continue-here files not cleaned up
- Added Pillar 4 (Self-Review & Signal Enrichment) to v1.15 candidate
- Created `/gsd:release` command (quick-4): thin orchestrator + 9-step workflow
- Fixed C7-C10 self-fulfilling tests (quick-5): 15 tests removed, 4 .todo() stubs, suite now 140 passing
- Made `/gsd:release` workflow project-agnostic (dynamic repo URL)
- Logged signal: release process fragile manual steps
- Captured todo: feature manifest system for declarative feature initialization
- Added Pillar 6 (Feature Manifest & Release Infrastructure) to v1.15 candidate
- Released v1.14.2 via manual release workflow (first clean release — no tag juggling)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
None — all pre-v1.15 tasks complete. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to start v1.15.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- v1.14.2 released with `/gsd:release` command + C7-C10 test cleanup
- `/gsd:release` takes [patch|minor|major] arg; if omitted, analyzes commits and recommends
- Feature manifest system needed: each GSD feature declares config schema, scope (user vs project), init prompts
- v1.15 candidate expanded to 6 pillars (added Pillar 6: Feature Manifest & Release Infrastructure)
- `/gsd:release` currently hardcodes npm/package.json assumptions — will be made configurable via manifest system in v1.15
</decisions_made>
