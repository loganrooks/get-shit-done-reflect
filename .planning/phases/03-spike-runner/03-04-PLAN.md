<objective>
Document the spike decision point integration for plan-phase and new-project orchestrators.

Purpose: This reference document specifies exactly where and how orchestrators should add the spike decision point step. Following the fork constraint (additive only), this provides the specification for integration rather than modifying existing orchestrator files directly. Orchestrators can read this reference to understand when and how to trigger spikes.

Output: A reference document that serves as the integration specification for spike decision points.

  <files>get-shit-done/references/spike-integration.md</files>
  <action>
Create `get-shit-done/references/spike-integration.md` as the authoritative reference for integrating spike decision points into GSD orchestrators. This is a NEW file (fork constraint: additive only).

**Document content:**

```markdown
# Spike Integration Reference

Specifies where and how to add spike decision points to GSD orchestrators. This document enables orchestrators to read and apply spike integration without modifying their core files.

## Overview

The spike decision point is a step that runs AFTER research completes and BEFORE planning/requirements. It checks for genuine gaps (questions that research couldn't answer) and triggers spikes when appropriate.

**Integration pattern:** Additive step insertion. The spike decision point is a new step added between existing steps, not a modification of existing steps.

**Fork compatibility:** Orchestrators check for this reference doc. If it exists, they apply the spike decision point. If it doesn't exist (upstream GSD), they skip it.

## Open Questions Schema

For artifacts that capture Open Questions (PROJECT.md, CONTEXT.md):

```markdown
## Open Questions

| Question | Why It Matters | Criticality | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| [Clear question] | [Impact if wrong] | Critical/Medium/Low | Pending |
```

For RESEARCH.md (post-verification):

```markdown
## Open Questions

### Resolved
- {Question}: {How research answered it}

### Genuine Gaps
| Question | Criticality | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| {Question} | Critical/Medium/Low | Spike/Defer/Accept-risk |

### Resolved by Spike
1. **{Question}**
   - Decision: {one-line answer}
   - Evidence: {brief summary}
   - Full analysis: {path to DECISION.md}
   - Confidence: {HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}

### Still Open
- {Questions that couldn't be resolved - flagged for attention}
```

## plan-phase Integration

### Where to Insert

After research completes (Step 5 in standard plan-phase flow), before planning begins:

```
Step 5: Research completes, RESEARCH.md created
        ↓
Step 5.5: SPIKE DECISION POINT (NEW)
        ↓
Step 6: Planner runs with updated RESEARCH.md
```

### Integration Logic

```markdown
## 5.5. Handle Spike Decision Point

**Check for genuine gaps:**

Read `{PHASE_DIR}/*-RESEARCH.md`. Look for "### Genuine Gaps" section.

If no Genuine Gaps section or section is empty: proceed to planning.

If Genuine Gaps exist:

1. **Parse gaps:**
   ```
   For each gap in Genuine Gaps table:
     - question: the question text
     - criticality: Critical | Medium | Low
     - recommendation: Spike | Defer | Accept-risk
   ```

2. **Apply sensitivity filter:**
   ```
   sensitivity = config.spike_sensitivity OR derive from config.depth

   - conservative: only process Critical gaps with Spike recommendation
   - balanced: process Critical + Medium gaps with Spike recommendation
   - aggressive: process all gaps with Spike recommendation
   ```

3. **Apply autonomy mode:**
   ```
   mode = config.mode

   - interactive: present filtered gaps, ask user which to spike
   - yolo: auto-spike all filtered gaps
   ```

4. **Execute spikes:**
   ```
   For each approved spike:
     Invoke get-shit-done/workflows/run-spike.md with:
       - question: gap.question
       - phase: current phase number
   ```

5. **Proceed to planning:**

   RESEARCH.md now contains "Resolved by Spike" entries.
   Planner treats these as locked decisions.
```

### Planner Instruction Addition

When planner reads RESEARCH.md, it should treat spike resolutions as locked decisions:

```markdown
## Reading RESEARCH.md

**Spike Resolutions:** If RESEARCH.md contains "Resolved by Spike" entries,
treat these as locked decisions (same weight as CONTEXT.md user decisions).
Spikes produced empirical evidence -- don't second-guess them.
```

## new-project Integration

### Where to Insert

After project research completes, before requirements definition:

```
Step: Project research completes (4 parallel researchers), SUMMARY.md created
        ↓
Step: SPIKE DECISION POINT (NEW)
        ↓
Step: Requirements definition with updated research
```

### Integration Logic

Similar to plan-phase, but reading from project research SUMMARY.md instead of phase RESEARCH.md:

```markdown
## Handle Spike Decision Point (Project Level)

**Check research summary for genuine gaps:**

Read `.planning/research-project/SUMMARY.md`. Look for "Open Questions" section with "Genuine Gaps" subsection.

If no gaps: proceed to requirements.

If gaps exist: apply same sensitivity/autonomy logic as plan-phase.

**Spike workspace naming:**
- Project-level spikes: originating_phase: "project-level"
- No phase RESEARCH.md to update
- Results inform requirements definition directly
```

## Sensitivity Decision Matrix

| Sensitivity | Autonomy | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Conservative | YOLO | Auto-spike Critical gaps only |
| Conservative | Interactive | Ask only for Critical gaps |
| Balanced | YOLO | Auto-spike Critical + Medium gaps |
| Balanced | Interactive | Ask for Critical + Medium gaps |
| Aggressive | YOLO | Auto-spike all genuine gaps |
| Aggressive | Interactive | Ask for all genuine gaps |

**Deriving sensitivity from depth:**
- depth: quick -> spike_sensitivity: conservative
- depth: standard -> spike_sensitivity: balanced
- depth: comprehensive -> spike_sensitivity: aggressive

Explicit `spike_sensitivity` in config.json overrides derivation.

## Plan-Checker Addition

The plan-checker should verify spike decision compliance:

```markdown
## Verification Dimensions

### Spike Decision Compliance

If spike decisions exist for this phase:
- [ ] Plan uses approaches chosen by spikes
- [ ] No contradiction with empirical conclusions
- [ ] Spike decisions referenced where relevant

**Flag example:** "Plan uses Library A, but spike finding chose Library B"
```

## Template Updates

### PROJECT.md Template Addition

Add to project.md template:

```markdown
## Open Questions

| Question | Why It Matters | Criticality | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| {Question 1} | {Impact} | {Critical/Medium/Low} | Pending |

{Capture uncertainties during project Q&A. Research phase will attempt to resolve.}
```

### CONTEXT.md Template Addition

Add to context.md template:

```markdown
## Open Questions

| Question | Why It Matters | Criticality | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| {Question 1} | {Impact} | {Critical/Medium/Low} | Pending |

{Capture uncertainties during phase discussion. Research will attempt to resolve.}
```

### RESEARCH.md Template Addition

Add to research.md template:

```markdown
## Open Questions

### Resolved
- {Question}: {How research answered it}

### Genuine Gaps
| Question | Criticality | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| {Question} | {Critical/Medium/Low} | {Spike/Defer/Accept-risk} |

### Resolved by Spike
{Populated by orchestrator after spike completes}

### Still Open
{Questions that couldn't be resolved}
```

## Orchestrator Detection Pattern

Orchestrators can check if spike integration should be applied:

```bash
# Check if spike integration exists
if [ -f "get-shit-done/references/spike-integration.md" ]; then
  # Apply spike decision point logic
  # Read this reference for integration steps
else
  # Standard flow without spike decision point
  # (upstream GSD without reflect fork)
fi
```

This pattern maintains compatibility with upstream GSD while enabling spike integration in the fork.

Capture uncertainties during project initialization. Research phase will attempt to resolve these. Unresolved critical questions may trigger spikes.
```

**For get-shit-done/templates/context.md:**

Read the current file, then append:

```markdown
## Open Questions

| Question | Why It Matters | Criticality | Status |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| {Question from phase discussion} | {Impact on this phase} | {Critical/Medium/Low} | Pending |

Capture uncertainties during phase discussion. Phase research will attempt to resolve these.
```

**For get-shit-done/templates/research.md:**

Read the current file, then append or update the appropriate section:

```markdown
## Open Questions

Recommendation guidance:
- Spike: Critical question, empirical answer possible
- Defer: Not blocking, can answer later
- Accept-risk: Proceed with assumption, acknowledge uncertainty

### Resolved by Spike
{Section populated by orchestrator after spike completes}

### Still Open
{Questions that couldn't be resolved - flagged for downstream attention}
