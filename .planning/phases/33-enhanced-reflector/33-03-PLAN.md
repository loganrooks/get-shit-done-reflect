<objective>
Rewrite gsd-reflector.md as a lifecycle-aware reflector with confidence-weighted pattern detection, counter-evidence seeking, triage proposals, remediation suggestions, lesson distillation with evidence snapshots, and spike candidate identification.

Purpose: This is the core implementation of Phase 33 -- the reflector agent spec is where all 8 REFLECT requirements come together. Plans 01 and 02 established the detection rules and output infrastructure. This plan rewrites the reflector to USE those rules and PRODUCE that output. The reflector transforms accumulated signals into actionable triage decisions, distilled lessons, and remediation suggestions.

Output: Complete rewrite of gsd-reflector.md implementing REFLECT-01 through REFLECT-08.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite reflector with lifecycle-aware analysis and confidence-weighted detection</name>
  <files>agents/gsd-reflector.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite gsd-reflector.md as a major upgrade. Preserve the existing frontmatter (name, description, tools, color) and the `<required_reading>` section. Replace the execution_flow and guidelines sections with lifecycle-aware versions.

**Preserve unchanged:**
- Frontmatter (name, description, tools, color)
- `<role>` section (update to mention lifecycle awareness, triage, remediation)
- `<references>` section (keep existing references)
- `<inputs>` section (keep existing, NO new flags needed -- lifecycle features activate automatically)
- `<required_reading>` section

**Rewrite `<execution_flow>` with these steps:**

**Step 1: Load Configuration** (keep existing)

**Step 2: Load Signals with Lifecycle Awareness (REFLECT-01)**

Replace the current Step 2 with a two-pass approach:

a. **Index pass:** Read `~/.gsd/knowledge/index.md`. For each signal row matching scope:
   - Extract: id, project, severity, tags, lifecycle_state (from index)
   - For signals missing lifecycle_state column: default to `detected`
   - For SIG-format signals (ID starts with `SIG-`): mark as legacy, treat as read-only
   - Build a metadata list WITHOUT reading full signal files

b. **Lifecycle filtering:**
   - `detected` (or absent): Full analysis candidate -- include in pattern detection, triage proposals, lesson distillation
   - `triaged`: Include in pattern detection and lesson distillation. SKIP triage proposals (already triaged). Show triage.decision in report.
   - `remediated`: Lower weight in pattern detection (multiply weight by 0.5). Track for dashboard.
   - `verified`: Exclude from pattern detection. Include in positive pattern analysis only.
   - `invalidated`: Exclude entirely from all analysis.

c. **Lifecycle dashboard data:** Count signals by state for dashboard output (passed back to workflow).

**Step 3: Detect Patterns with Confidence-Weighted Scoring (REFLECT-02)**

Replace the current Step 3 with confidence-weighted detection:

a. **Cluster signals** using existing criteria from reflection-patterns.md Section 2.2 (same signal_type + 2+ overlapping tags). Positive and negative signals cluster separately.

b. **For each cluster, compute weighted_score:**
```
weighted_score = sum(weight(signal) for signal in cluster)
weight(signal) = confidence_weight * severity_multiplier * lifecycle_modifier

confidence_weight: high -> 2.0, medium -> 1.0, low -> 0.5
  (default medium for signals missing confidence field)
severity_multiplier: critical -> 1.5, notable -> 1.0, minor -> 0.7
lifecycle_modifier: detected/triaged -> 1.0, remediated -> 0.5
```

c. **Apply threshold** based on max severity in cluster (from reflection-patterns.md Section 2.1):
   - critical: 3.0
   - notable: 4.0
   - minor: 5.0

d. **Detail pass:** For clusters that meet the threshold, NOW read the full signal files to get body content, evidence, and detailed context. This is the second pass -- only qualifying clusters trigger full file reads.

**Step 3.5: Counter-Evidence Seeking (REFLECT-03)**

New step after pattern detection:

a. For each qualifying pattern, search for counter-evidence per reflection-patterns.md Section 2.5:
   - Check for positive signals with same tags
   - Check for remediated/verified signals about the same issue
   - Check for time-decay (all signals > 30 days old with no recent recurrence)

b. Bounded to 3 counter-examples per pattern.

c. Adjust pattern confidence based on counter-evidence found:
   - 0: Pattern confirmed
   - 1: Reduce confidence one level
   - 2-3: Reduce confidence two levels or flag as "investigate"

d. Record counter-evidence in pattern details.

**Step 4: Phase-End Reflection** (keep existing Step 4 largely unchanged)

**Step 5: Generate Triage Proposals (REFLECT-05)**

New step. For each qualifying pattern where cluster signals are in `detected` state:

a. Generate triage proposal:
```yaml
proposal:
  cluster: "{pattern-name}"
  signals: [sig-xxx, sig-yyy, sig-zzz]
  recommended_decision: address | dismiss | defer | investigate
  rationale: "..."
  recommended_priority: critical | high | medium | low
  recommended_action: "..."
```

b. Decision logic:
   - `address`: Pattern has clear root cause AND actionable fix AND high/medium confidence
   - `dismiss`: Pattern is noise OR all signals are stale with no recurrence
   - `defer`: Pattern exists but is low priority (minor severity, low confidence)
   - `investigate`: Pattern needs spike -- unclear root cause, counter-evidence found, or low confidence after adjustment

c. SIG-format signals are NEVER included in triage write operations (read-only legacy data). They contribute to pattern detection but are not themselves triaged.

d. **Phase 33 triage constraint:** When writing triage fields to critical signals that lack lifecycle_state, the reflector MUST FIRST add `evidence: { supporting: ["...at least one entry..."] }`. Validate with `frontmatter validate --schema signal` after modification. Reference 31-04 backward_compat rule.

e. Triage write pattern (for approved proposals):
   - Read complete signal file
   - Parse frontmatter with extractFrontmatter()
   - Add/update ONLY mutable fields: lifecycle_state, triage, lifecycle_log, updated
   - Reconstruct frontmatter + original body
   - Write back and validate
   - Confirm frozen fields are unchanged via before/after comparison

**Step 6: Distill Lessons with Evidence Snapshots (REFLECT-04)**

Enhance existing Step 5 (lesson distillation):

a. Keep existing distillation criteria (threshold met, consistent root cause, actionable).

b. **Add evidence_snapshots:** For each evidence signal, extract a one-sentence snapshot of the key observation. Include as `evidence_snapshots` field in lesson frontmatter:
```yaml
evidence_snapshots:
  - id: sig-xxx
    snapshot: "One-sentence summary of what this signal observed"
```

c. This makes lessons self-contained -- if evidence signals are later archived, the lesson still contains the key observations.

d. Use the updated kb-templates/lesson.md template (from Plan 02) which includes the evidence_snapshots and confidence fields.

**Step 7: Generate Remediation Suggestions (REFLECT-06)**

New step. For each triaged cluster with decision `address`:

a. Generate plan-level remediation suggestion (NOT action-level):
```markdown
### Remediation Suggestion: {cluster-name}

**Signals:** {signal IDs}
**Suggested approach:** {what to do}
**Suggested plan scope:** {which phase/plan could address this}
**Priority:** {from triage.priority}
```

b. The reflector does NOT write remediation fields to signals. It only suggests. Phase 34 handles `resolves_signals`.

**Step 8: Flag Spike Candidates (REFLECT-08)**

New step. Identify spike candidates per reflection-patterns.md Section 12:

a. Patterns with triage.decision = "investigate"
b. Patterns with adjusted confidence = "low" after counter-evidence
c. Marginal patterns (weighted score within 20% of threshold but below)

Format each as a spike candidate with question, rationale, and suggested experiment.

**Step 9: Semantic Drift Check** (keep existing Step 6, renumber)

**Step 10: Report Results** (keep existing Step 7, renumber)

Update output_format to include:
- Lifecycle Dashboard section (from workflow, but agent populates data)
- Triage Proposals section
- Remediation Suggestions section
- Spike Candidates section
- Evidence snapshots in lesson output

**Rewrite `<guidelines>` section:**

Keep all existing guidelines and ADD:
- Two-pass signal reading: index pass first, detail pass only for qualifying clusters (context budget management)
- Legacy SIG-format signals: read-only for analysis, never modify, infer missing fields (lifecycle_state -> detected, signal_category -> from polarity or type)
- Phase 33 triage constraint: critical signals need evidence before lifecycle_state (reference knowledge-store.md Section 4.2)
- Mutability boundary: list frozen vs mutable fields explicitly
- Counter-evidence bound: max 3 per pattern
- Remediation suggestions are plan-level, not action-level
- Spike candidates are identified, not created (reflector reports them, user/spike-runner acts)

<success_criteria>
gsd-reflector.md implements all 8 REFLECT requirements as a lifecycle-aware reflector agent. The agent reads lifecycle state, computes confidence-weighted scores, seeks counter-evidence, generates triage proposals, distills evidence-snapshot lessons, suggests remediation, populates lifecycle dashboard data, and flags spike candidates. Two-pass signal reading prevents context budget overflow. Phase 33 triage constraint is respected for critical signals.
