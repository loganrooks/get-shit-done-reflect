<objective>
Define the complete extended signal schema specification, update the signal creation template, add project settings for signal lifecycle configuration, and update agent specs to reflect the new mutability boundary.

Purpose: Establishes the authoritative data model that all downstream phases (32-35) build behavior on. This is the foundation -- knowledge-store.md becomes the single source of truth for what a signal contains and how its fields behave. Agent specs are updated to remove the blanket "signals are immutable" guideline that would conflict with lifecycle field mutation in Phase 33+.

Output: Updated knowledge-store.md with lifecycle/epistemic/mutability/positive-signal specs, updated signal.md template, feature-manifest.json with 5 project settings, updated gsd-signal-collector.md and gsd-reflector.md with mutability boundary references.

  <name>Task 1: Extend knowledge-store.md with lifecycle, epistemic, and mutability specifications</name>
  <files>agents/knowledge-store.md</files>
  <action>
Major update to the authoritative signal schema specification. Edit agents/knowledge-store.md (NOT .claude/agents/) per CLAUDE.md dual-directory rule.

**Section 3 (Common Base Schema):** Add `signal_category` to the optional fields note (positive/negative, defaults to negative for backward compatibility).

**Section 4 (Type-Specific Extensions > Signal Extensions):** Expand the signal extensions table substantially. Add these new fields to the signal extensions:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `lifecycle_state` | enum | no | `detected` | `detected`, `triaged`, `remediated`, `verified`, `invalidated` |
| `signal_category` | enum | no | `negative` | `positive` or `negative` |
| `evidence` | object | conditional | `{}` | Contains `supporting` (array of strings) and `counter` (array of strings) |
| `confidence` | enum | no | `medium` | `high`, `medium`, or `low` |
| `confidence_basis` | string | no | `""` | Text explaining confidence assessment |
| `triage` | object | no | `{}` | Contains `decision` (address/dismiss/defer/investigate), `rationale`, `priority` (critical/high/medium/low), `by`, `at`, `severity_override` |
| `remediation` | object | no | `{}` | Contains `status` (planned/in-progress/complete), `resolved_by_plan`, `approach`, `at` |
| `verification` | object | no | `{}` | Contains `status` (pending/passed/failed), `method` (absence-of-recurrence/active-retest/evidence-review), `evidence_required` (for critical: active-retest), `at` |
| `recurrence_of` | string | no | `null` (use empty string "") | Signal ID this is a recurrence of |
| `lifecycle_log` | array | no | `[]` | Array of strings: `"detected->triaged by reflector at 2026-02-28T10:00:00Z: rationale"` |

Mark `evidence` as REQUIRED when severity is `critical` (conditional requirement). For `notable`, evidence is RECOMMENDED. For `minor` and `trace`, evidence is OPTIONAL.

Use empty objects `{}` (NOT null) for unset triage/remediation/verification -- per Pitfall 6 from research (reconstructFrontmatter silently drops null values). Note: `reconstructFrontmatter()` normalizes `triage: {}` to `triage:` (bare key). This is functionally equivalent -- the bare key re-parses as an empty object. The roundtrip is stable.

lifecycle_log entries MUST be quoted strings in YAML to protect special characters (colons, arrows). Example: `- "detected->triaged by reflector at 2026-02-28T10:00:00Z: rationale"`

**NEW Section 4.2: Lifecycle State Machine.** Add after the signal extensions table. Document:
- State diagram: detected -> triaged -> remediated -> verified, plus invalidated (terminal) from any state
- Regression paths: recurrence resets to detected (with severity escalation per recurrence_escalation project setting)
- Transition table (from/to/trigger/who-can-trigger) -- use the table from RESEARCH.md Section "Lifecycle State Machine"
- Skip rules by lifecycle_strictness setting: strict (all states required), flexible (detected->remediated allowed, detected->verified NOT allowed), minimal (any forward transition)
- Dismissed = triage decision value (`triage.decision: dismiss`), NOT a lifecycle state
- Existing 46 signals: absent lifecycle_state defaults to `detected`; bulk triage deferred to Phase 33
- When a signal enters the `invalidated` terminal state, its `status` field is simultaneously set to `archived` to remove it from the active signal pool. The invalidation reason is preserved in `lifecycle_log`.

**NEW Section 4.3: Epistemic Rigor Requirements.** Add after state machine. Document:
- The five epistemic principles (from CONTEXT.md): proportional rigor, epistemic humility, evidence independence, mandatory counter-evidence, meta-epistemic reflection
- Tiered rigor table by severity:
  - critical: counter-evidence REQUIRED (hard fail without it), active verification required, confidence_basis REQUIRED
  - notable: counter-evidence RECOMMENDED (warn if missing), passive verification acceptable
  - minor: evidence summary sufficient, no counter-evidence required
  - trace: minimal -- detection context only, not persisted to KB
- Evidence independence rule: repeated citations of same fact are NOT corroboration
- Epistemic gap signals: signal_type `epistemic-gap`, signal_category `negative`, confidence inherently `low`
- Meta-evidence: system annotates evidence quality in confidence_basis
- Rigor enforcement behavior determined by project setting `rigor_enforcement` (strict/warn/permissive)

**NEW Section 4.4: Positive Signals.** Document:
- Three types: baseline, improvement, good-pattern (via signal_type field extension)
- signal_category: positive, polarity: positive (both set)
- `signal_category` is the authoritative field for positive/negative classification. `polarity` is retained for backward compatibility but `signal_category` takes precedence when both are present. New signals MUST set both fields consistently.
- Same lifecycle applies with semantic reinterpretation (verified = baseline confirmed stable)
- Triple purpose: lesson inputs, regression guards, cross-project transfer
- Severity tiers apply equally (a critical baseline is possible)

**Section 10 (Lifecycle Rules) update:**
- Replace the Signal row in the Mutability table: "Signal" was "Immutable after creation" / "Signals capture a moment in time". Change to: "Signal detection payload frozen after creation; lifecycle fields (lifecycle_state, lifecycle_log, triage, remediation, verification, updated) are mutable"
- Add explicit frozen/mutable field lists:
  - FROZEN: id, type, project, tags, created, durability, severity (initial sensor assessment), signal_type, signal_category, phase, plan, polarity, source, occurrence_count, related_signals, runtime, model, gsd_version, evidence.supporting (initial), evidence.counter (initial), confidence (initial), confidence_basis (initial), recurrence_of
  - MUTABLE: lifecycle_state, lifecycle_log, triage.*, remediation.*, verification.*, updated, status
- Note that triage.severity_override records disagreement between sensor and triage assessments (per locked decision about severity disagreements being recorded)
- Note: enforcement is agent-based (agent specs define which fields each agent may modify), with optional validation warning in gsd-tools.js

**Backward compatibility note** (add near the existing 46 signals mention or as a subsection in Section 4.2):
15 legacy SIG-format signals (SIG-260222-*, SIG-260223-*) predate the standard schema and may contain non-standard field values (e.g., `status: resolved`, `type: positive-pattern`). These are readable via extractFrontmatter but are not subject to formal schema validation. Schema validation is opt-in -- agents call `frontmatter validate --schema signal` only on NEW signals they create.

**Section 9 (Index Format) update:**
- Update the Signals table header to add Lifecycle column:
  `| ID | Project | Severity | Lifecycle | Tags | Date | Status |`
- Note: lifecycle_state is a top-level field specifically for index grep compatibility (per research finding about kb-rebuild-index.sh)

Preserve all existing sections that are not being modified. Do NOT delete or rewrite sections 1-3, 5-8, 11-13 unless minor cross-references are needed.

{Where and when this occurred -- phase, plan, task, what was being attempted}

## Potential Cause

{Best understanding of why this happened}
```

Add a comment block after the frontmatter closing `---` but before `## What Happened` that describes field requirements by severity:
```
<!-- Field requirements by severity:
  critical: evidence.supporting REQUIRED, evidence.counter REQUIRED, confidence_basis REQUIRED
  notable: evidence RECOMMENDED, confidence RECOMMENDED
  minor: evidence OPTIONAL
  trace: not persisted to KB (collection report only)

  <name>Task 3: Update agent spec immutability guidelines to reference mutability boundary</name>
  <files>agents/gsd-signal-collector.md, agents/gsd-reflector.md</files>
  <action>
Update the immutability guidelines in both agent specs to reference the new mutability boundary defined in knowledge-store.md Section 10. Edit the npm source files (NOT .claude/agents/) per CLAUDE.md dual-directory rule.

**agents/gsd-signal-collector.md:**
Find the existing guideline that says signals are immutable (e.g., "Never modify signal files (signals are immutable)" or similar wording). Replace it with the mutability boundary rule:
- "Detection payload fields are frozen after creation. Lifecycle fields (lifecycle_state, lifecycle_log, triage, remediation, verification, updated) may be modified by authorized agents. See knowledge-store.md Section 10 for the complete frozen/mutable field list."
- The signal-collector's authorized mutations: NONE -- the signal-collector creates signals but does not modify existing ones. Its immutability guideline should clarify: "The signal-collector creates new signals only. It does not modify existing signal files. Other agents (reflector, synthesizer) may modify lifecycle fields per the mutability boundary in knowledge-store.md Section 10."

**agents/gsd-reflector.md:**
Find the existing guideline that says signals are immutable (e.g., "Never modify signal files (signals are immutable)" or similar wording). Replace it with the mutability boundary rule:
- "Detection payload fields are frozen after creation. Lifecycle fields (lifecycle_state, lifecycle_log, triage, remediation, verification, updated) may be modified by authorized agents. See knowledge-store.md Section 10 for the complete frozen/mutable field list."
- The reflector's authorized mutations: triage fields (triage.decision, triage.rationale, triage.priority, triage.by, triage.at, triage.severity_override), lifecycle_state (detected->triaged transition only), lifecycle_log (append transition entries), updated timestamp.
- Add note: "The reflector does NOT modify detection payload fields (id, type, project, tags, created, severity, signal_type, evidence, confidence, etc.). These are frozen at creation."

After editing both files, run `node bin/install.js --local` to propagate changes to .claude/agents/.
  </action>
  <verify>
- `grep "mutability boundary" agents/gsd-signal-collector.md` returns match
- `grep "mutability boundary" agents/gsd-reflector.md` returns match

- `grep -i "signals are immutable" agents/gsd-reflector.md` returns NO matches (old guideline removed)
- `grep "knowledge-store.md Section 10" agents/gsd-signal-collector.md` returns match
- `grep "knowledge-store.md Section 10" agents/gsd-reflector.md` returns match
  </verify>
  <done>
Both agent specs reference the mutability boundary from knowledge-store.md Section 10. The blanket "signals are immutable" guideline is replaced with the nuanced frozen/mutable distinction. Each agent's authorized mutations are explicitly documented. Phase 33 (Enhanced Reflector) can now modify triage/lifecycle fields without hitting a contradictory guideline.

The authoritative signal schema specification, creation template, project settings, and agent mutability guidelines are complete and internally consistent. A reader of knowledge-store.md can understand every field a signal may contain, when it is required, and how lifecycle state transitions work. Agent specs correctly reference the mutability boundary, unblocking Phase 33's reflector enhancements.
