ALL 21 PLANS ACROSS 6 PHASES COMPLETE. Phase 0 execution just finished (plans 00-05 and 00-06). Milestone is ready for audit (`/gsd:audit-milestone`), BUT user wants to discuss adding a new phase first.

The user is considering a Phase 6 around "workspace health / maintenance / DevOps setup catch-up" before archiving the milestone. This discussion was started but paused to preserve context quality.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

This session:
- Executed Phase 0 remaining plans (00-05 and 00-06) in parallel wave
- 00-05: Fixed fork package name refs, benchmark comparison logic, ESM warnings, CI hardening
- 00-06: Release notes automation, smoke test workflow, branch protection via `gh api`
- Branch protection configured on main via `gh api` (Test status check required, enforce admins, dismiss stale reviews, conversation resolution required, auto-delete branches)
- Phase 0 verified (5/5 must-haves passed)
- ROADMAP.md updated: Phase 0 marked complete (6/6 plans)
- STATE.md updated: 21/21 plans complete
- Committed: `7ab9409 docs(00): complete deployment infrastructure phase`
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

1. DECISION NEEDED: Whether to add a new phase before auditing/archiving milestone
2. Then: `/gsd:audit-milestone` to verify cross-phase integration and requirements
3. Then: `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive

Uncommitted pre-existing files (not from this session):

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Branch protection configured via `gh api` (not manual GitHub UI) — the plan's Task 3 was marked as human-action but user correctly pointed out `gh` CLI can do this
- Verifier false-positive on branch protection corrected — it checked before the `gh api` call ran
- VERIFICATION.md updated from gaps_found to passed after confirming branch protection active
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None technical. Strategic decision pending on new phase.

## Potential Phase 6: Workspace Health / Maintenance / DevOps Catch-up

The user raised several interconnected concerns about what GSD Reflect should do when deployed into real workspaces:

### Problem 1: Version Upgrade Catch-up
When a user upgrades GSD or GSD Reflect to a newer version, new features may have been added (e.g., DevOps setup questions, new initialization steps). Projects initialized under the old version are "incomplete" from the new version's perspective. There needs to be a way to "catch up" — run any new setup steps, checklists, or configuration that the newer version introduced.

### Problem 2: Workspace Health / Maintenance
A `/gsd:maintenance` or `/gsd:health-check` skill that:
- Checks the repo's adherence to GSD protocols
- Identifies deviations or things that were skipped
- Fixes what it can, flags what it can't
- Example: "No proper DevOps workflow documented? Let's set one up"
- Example: "Initialization questioning workflow wasn't fully run? Let's complete it"

### Problem 3: Codebase Mapping Integration
During `/gsd:map-codebase` for existing projects, the mapper might identify subpar DevOps workflows (among other non-best-practice patterns). Could this feed into:
- Optional cleanup phases in the roadmap
- Suggestions during initialization
- Integration with the health-check/maintenance skill

### Problem 4: DevOps as Part of Initialization
Currently `/gsd:new-project` asks about mode, depth, parallelization, git tracking, model profile — but NOTHING about:
- Branching strategy
- CI/CD needs
- Deployment targets
- Environment strategy
- Quality gates
- Release cadence

Should these be part of project setup?

### Key Insight from User
This isn't just about DevOps — it's about GSD Reflect being able to ADAPT to workspaces in various states of setup, and having the ability to incrementally bring them up to the standard the system expects. The dogfooding use case (reinstalling updated GSD Reflect in this very repo) is the immediate test case.

### Open Design Questions
- Is this one phase or multiple concerns?
- Is "catch-up on upgrade" a skill/command or a phase?
- Should maintenance be reactive (user invokes) or proactive (runs automatically)?
- How does this interact with existing codebase-mapping?
- Does this belong in v1 milestone or v2?

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:resume-work`. Then decide:
1. If adding a phase: use `/gsd:add-phase` or `/gsd:discuss-phase` to scope it
2. If deferring to v2: proceed directly to `/gsd:audit-milestone`

The user's instinct was toward adding it to v1 but wants to discuss scope with fresh context.
