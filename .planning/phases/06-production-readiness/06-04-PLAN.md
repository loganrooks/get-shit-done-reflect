<objective>
Create fork-specific identity: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json updates, and help.md additions.

Purpose: The fork needs its own identity that distinguishes it from upstream GSD while crediting the original. The README is the first thing users see -- it must clearly communicate what GSD Reflect adds (the learning loop) and how to get started. The CHANGELOG tracks fork-specific changes. Help.md needs the new Phase 6 commands listed.

Output: One replaced README, one new CHANGELOG, one modified package.json, and one additive update to help.md.

  <action>
**Replace `README.md`** with GSD Reflect's own identity README.

Identity: "An AI coding agent that learns from its mistakes" -- the learning loop is the core value proposition.

Structure the README with these sections (keep under 300 lines total):

**Header block:**
- Title: "GSD Reflect"
- Tagline: "An AI coding agent that learns from its mistakes"
- Subtitle: "Built on top of [GSD](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) by TACHES"
- npm badge pointing to `get-shit-done-reflect-cc` package
- GitHub stars badge pointing to fork repo
- License badge

**Install command:**
```bash
npx get-shit-done-reflect-cc
```

**What is GSD Reflect:**
- GSD Reflect extends GSD with a persistent learning system
- Core value: The system never makes the same mistake twice
- Three additions: signal tracking, spike/experiment workflow, persistent cross-project knowledge base
- All upstream GSD features included (planning, execution, verification, debugging)

**What's Different from GSD:**

Brief comparison (table format):
| Feature | GSD | GSD Reflect |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Project planning | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-agent execution | Yes | Yes |
| Signal tracking | -- | Automatic deviation detection |
| Spike experiments | -- | Structured experimentation |
| Knowledge base | -- | Persistent cross-project lessons |
| Reflection engine | -- | Pattern detection and lesson distillation |
| Knowledge surfacing | -- | Auto-retrieval during research |
| Health check | -- | Workspace validation and repair |
| Version migration | -- | Seamless feature upgrades |
| DevOps context | -- | Adaptive initialization |

**The Learning Loop:**
Brief explanation of how signals -> reflection -> lessons -> surfacing creates a self-improving cycle:
1. Signals capture what went wrong during execution
2. Reflection detects patterns across signals
3. Lessons are distilled into actionable knowledge
4. Surfacing retrieves relevant lessons before they're needed

**Getting Started:**
Same install/verify flow as upstream:
1. `npx get-shit-done-reflect-cc` to install
2. `/gsd:help` to verify
3. `/gsd:new-project` to start

**GSD Reflect Commands (additions):**
Table listing GSD Reflect-specific commands:
| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/gsd:signal` | Manually log a signal |
| `/gsd:collect-signals` | Analyze phase for deviations |
| `/gsd:reflect` | Detect patterns and distill lessons |
| `/gsd:health-check` | Validate workspace state |
| `/gsd:upgrade-project` | Migrate project to current version |

Note: "All standard GSD commands (/gsd:new-project, /gsd:plan-phase, etc.) work identically. Run /gsd:help for the full command reference."

**Upstream Credit:**
"GSD Reflect is built on top of [Get Shit Done](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) by [TACHES](https://github.com/glittercowboy). The core planning, execution, and verification system is theirs. GSD Reflect adds the learning loop."

**License:**
MIT License.

Do NOT include:
- Star history chart (fork's own history will grow)
- Discord link (fork doesn't have its own)
- Detailed command reference (that's in /gsd:help)
- Full "How It Works" section (refer to /gsd:help or upstream README)
- Testimonial quotes (fork hasn't earned its own yet)

**Create `CHANGELOG.md`** with GSD Reflect's own changelog:

```markdown

*GSD Reflect is built on top of [GSD](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done). See upstream changelog for base system changes.*
```

Note: Version numbers are approximations based on phase completion dates. The executor should verify the current package.json version and adjust accordingly.

CHANGELOG.md created with GSD Reflect-specific version history from Phase 0 through Phase 6, with reference to upstream changelog.

  <name>Task 2: Update package.json and help.md with new identity and commands</name>
  <files>package.json, commands/gsd/help.md</files>
  <action>
**Update `package.json`** (MODIFY -- identity fields only):

Read the current package.json first. Update these fields:
- `description`: Change to "A self-improving AI coding system that learns from its mistakes. Built on GSD by TACHES."
- `keywords`: Add fork-specific keywords while keeping relevant existing ones. Final list should include: `"claude"`, `"claude-code"`, `"ai"`, `"meta-prompting"`, `"context-engineering"`, `"spec-driven-development"`, `"gemini"`, `"gemini-cli"`, `"knowledge-base"`, `"signal-tracking"`, `"self-improving"`, `"reflection"`, `"gsd-reflect"`

Do NOT change:
- `name` (already correct: "get-shit-done-reflect-cc")
- `version` (already correct: "1.11.1" -- version bump happens at publish time)
- `bin`, `files`, `scripts`, `devDependencies` (all correct)
- `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs` (already pointing to fork)
- `author` (keep as upstream author -- fork credit is in README)
- `license` (keep MIT)

**Update `commands/gsd/help.md`** (ADDITIVE):

Read the current help.md first. Add the new Phase 6 commands to the appropriate sections.

Add to the "### GSD Reflect" section (create this section if it doesn't exist, placed AFTER "### Utility Commands" and BEFORE "## Files & Structure"):

```markdown
### GSD Reflect

GSD Reflect adds learning capabilities on top of GSD:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/gsd:signal` | Manually log a signal from current conversation |
| `/gsd:collect-signals <N>` | Analyze phase execution for deviations |
| `/gsd:health-check` | Validate workspace state (KB, config, stale artifacts) |
| `/gsd:upgrade-project` | Migrate project to current version with mini-onboarding |

*Reflection (`/gsd:reflect`) runs as part of milestone completion. Knowledge surfacing happens automatically during research and planning.*
```

IMPORTANT: Check if a "GSD Reflect" section or signal/reflect commands already exist in help.md. If they do, ADD the health-check and upgrade-project entries to the existing section rather than creating a duplicate. If they don't exist, add the full section.

Also update the "## Quick Start" section to mention the install command as `npx get-shit-done-reflect-cc` if it currently says `npx get-shit-done-cc`.

Also update the "## Staying Updated" section to use `npx get-shit-done-reflect-cc@latest` if it currently references the upstream package.

These are ADDITIVE changes -- no existing command entries should be modified or removed.
