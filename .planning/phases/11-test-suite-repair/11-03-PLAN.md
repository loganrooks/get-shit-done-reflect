<objective>
Update CI/CD workflows to run upstream gsd-tools tests and fork-specific tests alongside existing fork vitest tests. Update the install unit test to cover the merged installer's --claude/--opencode/--gemini flag behavior. Then run the complete test battery locally to confirm all suites pass and the sync branch is CI-ready.

Purpose: The CI currently only runs fork vitest tests (`npm test`) but not the 75 upstream gsd-tools tests or the new fork config tests. The install.test.js does not test the merged installer's runtime flag behavior. Without these in CI, regressions in upstream compatibility, fork config handling, or installer flag logic would go undetected.
Output: Updated ci.yml and publish.yml with upstream test steps, updated install.test.js with merged installer tests, confirmed all-green test battery.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add upstream and fork test steps to CI and publish workflows</name>
  <files>.github/workflows/ci.yml, .github/workflows/publish.yml</files>
  <action>
**Update .github/workflows/ci.yml:**

Add two new steps after the existing "Run infrastructure tests" step and before the "Verify install script" step:

```yaml
      - name: Run upstream gsd-tools tests
        run: npm run test:upstream

      - name: Run fork gsd-tools tests
        run: npm run test:upstream:fork
```

Keep all existing steps unchanged. The step order becomes:
1. Checkout
2. Setup Node.js (20.x)
3. Install dependencies
4. Build hooks
5. Run tests (vitest)
6. Run infrastructure tests
7. **Run upstream gsd-tools tests** (NEW)
8. **Run fork gsd-tools tests** (NEW)
9. Verify install script
10. Run tests with coverage (PR only)

**Update .github/workflows/publish.yml:**

Add upstream test steps before the "Publish to npm" step, after the existing "Run tests before publish" step:

```yaml
      - name: Run upstream tests before publish
        run: npm run test:upstream

      - name: Run fork tests before publish
        run: npm run test:upstream:fork
```

The step order becomes:
1. ... (existing steps through build:hooks)
2. Verify version matches release tag
3. Extract release notes
4. Update release notes
5. Run tests before publish (vitest)
6. **Run upstream tests before publish** (NEW)
7. **Run fork tests before publish** (NEW)
8. Publish to npm

Do NOT modify:
- The trigger branches (keep `branches: [main]` -- CI validation on sync branch will be done via PR to main)
- The Node.js version (keep 20.x)
- The smoke-test.yml (manual dispatch, unrelated to this change)
- Any existing step content

  <name>Task 2: Update install.test.js with merged installer flag tests</name>
  <files>tests/unit/install.test.js</files>
  <action>
The current install.test.js tests filesystem operations (directory creation, path replacement, settings.json) but does NOT test the merged installer's runtime flag behavior (--claude, --opencode, --gemini). This is a TEST-04 coverage gap.

Add a new `describe('merged installer flags', ...)` block to `tests/unit/install.test.js` that tests the installer via subprocess execution with different flag combinations. Use the existing `tmpdirTest` and `createMockHome` helpers from `tests/helpers/tmpdir.js`.

Add these test cases:

1. **"--claude flag installs to .claude directory"** -- Run `node bin/install.js --claude` with `HOME` set to a temp directory. Verify that `$HOME/.claude/commands/gsd/` exists and contains .md files, and `$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/` exists.

2. **"--opencode flag installs to opencode config directory"** -- Run `node bin/install.js --opencode` with appropriate env vars. Verify that the opencode config directory contains expected files. Set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to a temp directory to control the output location.

3. **"--claude --opencode installs to both directories"** -- Run with both flags. Verify both .claude and opencode directories are populated.

4. **"no flags prompts for runtime selection"** -- Run `node bin/install.js` without flags and verify it either prompts (stdin not a TTY may cause it to exit) or handles the no-flag case gracefully. Use `{ stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe'] }` and check the exit behavior.

For subprocess execution, use:
```javascript
import { execSync } from 'node:child_process'

const installScript = path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'bin/install.js')
execSync(`node "${installScript}" --claude`, {
  env: { ...process.env, HOME: tmpdir },
  cwd: tmpdir,
  stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe'],
  timeout: 10000
})
```

Read `bin/install.js` first to understand exact flag parsing and directory behavior before writing tests. The installer's `getDirName()` and `getGlobalDir()` functions determine output paths.

If tests for --opencode or --gemini are impractical (e.g., complex XDG path setup), at minimum test --claude (the primary use case) and document why others were skipped.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx vitest run tests/unit/install.test.js` -- all existing tests plus new merged installer flag tests pass</verify>
  <done>install.test.js has a "merged installer flags" describe block testing --claude flag (and --opencode if feasible). The --claude test verifies the installer creates .claude/commands/gsd/ and .claude/get-shit-done/ directories when invoked as a subprocess. All existing install tests continue to pass.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Run complete test battery locally and verify all-green</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Execute the full test battery that CI will run, in order:

1. `npm run build:hooks` -- verify hook build succeeds (CI prerequisite)
2. `npx vitest run` -- verify all fork tests pass (should be 42+ including new wiring validation tests from Plan 01 and new install tests from Task 2)
3. `npm run test:infra` -- verify infrastructure tests pass
4. `npm run test:upstream` -- verify all 75 upstream gsd-tools tests pass
5. `npm run test:upstream:fork` -- verify all fork config tests pass (from Plan 02)

Report results for each step:
- Pass/fail status
- Test count
- Duration
- Any warnings

If any step fails:
- `build:hooks` failure: Check if hook source files exist (`hooks/gsd-statusline.js`, `hooks/gsd-check-update.js`). The esbuild config may need path updates.
- vitest failure: If new wiring validation tests from Plan 01 fail, report the specific failure. If pre-existing tests fail, this is a regression to investigate.
- test:upstream failure: Should not fail -- these passed before Plans 01-02 (separate files). If they do, check for environment issues.
- test:upstream:fork failure: If fork config tests fail, check config-set/config-get behavior. May need assertion adjustments based on actual gsd-tools.js output format.

Also run the CI install verification step locally to verify it works:
```bash
INSTALL_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
HOME="$INSTALL_DIR" node bin/install.js --claude 2>&1 || true
ls -la "$INSTALL_DIR/.claude/commands/gsd" 2>/dev/null && echo "PASS: commands dir" || echo "FAIL: commands dir"
ls -la "$INSTALL_DIR/.claude/get-shit-done" 2>/dev/null && echo "PASS: gsd dir" || echo "FAIL: gsd dir"
rm -rf "$INSTALL_DIR"
```
  </action>
  <verify>All 5 test commands pass. Install verification passes. Report total test counts across all suites.</verify>
  <done>Complete test battery passes locally: vitest (42+ tests including new install flag tests), upstream gsd-tools (75 tests), fork gsd-tools (7+ tests), build:hooks succeeds, CI install verification passes. The sync branch is CI-ready.</done>
</task>
