# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** The system never makes the same mistake twice -- signals capture what went wrong, spikes resolve uncertainty empirically, and the knowledge base surfaces relevant lessons before they're needed.
**Current focus:** v1.20 Phase 55 -- Upstream Mini-Sync (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 55 of 64 (Upstream Mini-Sync)
Plan: 4 of 04 complete
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-08

Progress: [███████...] 75%

- 55-01: 1min, 2 tasks, 5 files
- 55-02: 9min, 2 tasks, 5 files
- 55-03: 9min, 2 tasks, 6 files
- 55-04: 6min, 2 tasks, 4 files

**v1.18 Final:**

- Plans completed: 37
- See milestones/v1.18-ROADMAP.md for per-plan breakdown

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.13-v1.18 decisions archived in milestones/ directories.

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [55-01]: Adopted model-profiles.cjs as-is from upstream f7549d43; plan mentioned resolveModel but upstream exports getAgentToModelMapForProfile -- file correct as upstream version
- [55-01]: Single commit for all 5 pure upstream modules per commit-per-merge-category strategy
- [Roadmap]: 10 phases (55-64) derived from 53 requirements across 9 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phase 55 (SYNC-01) must precede all other v1.20 work -- correctness substrate
- [Roadmap]: Phase 57 (telemetry baseline) must complete before Phase 58 (structural gates) -- ARCHITECTURE.md anti-pattern 4
- [Roadmap]: Phases 60 and 61 (sensors + spike methodology) can proceed in parallel -- independent workstreams
- [Roadmap]: Phase 64 (parallel execution) separately gated -- only triggered when parallel phases become regular practice
- [Roadmap]: Spike programme infrastructure (SPIKE-10a/b/c) in scope as Phase 63, after spike methodology operational
- [Roadmap]: SPIKE-08 gated on SPIKE-01 completion; auto-defers to v1.21 if SPIKE-01 ships late
- [Phase 55]: core.cjs: resolveModelInternal preserves fork gsdr- prefix normalization AND opus->inherit conversion (both fork-specific Claude Code behaviors)
- [Phase 55]: config.cjs: cmdForkConfigGet replaced with cmdConfigGetGraceful fork envelope {key,value,found} -- upstream cmdConfigGet returns raw value, fork tests require envelope
- [Phase 55]: model-profiles.cjs: 11 fork-only agents added after inline MODEL_PROFILES removed from core.cjs
- [55-03]: phase.cjs and roadmap.cjs wholesale replaced -- fork versions were simplified subsets of upstream, not extensions; no unique fork additions to re-apply
- [55-03]: complete-milestone.md C2 shell robustness guards already present in upstream v1.34.2 -- no re-application needed
- [55-03]: installer: applied 7 of 11 upstream fixes; 4 not applicable (.sh hooks, package.json); all fork extensions preserved (replacePathsInContent, dual-directory, gsdr- branding)
- [55-03]: buildLocalHookCommand: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR anchor (#1906) combined with existing test -f worktree guard -- both protections active
- [55-03]: uninstall per-hook granularity: isGsdrHookCommand covers both gsdr- (current) and gsd- (legacy) namespaces
- [Phase 55-04]: gsd-tools.test.js: upstream path does not exist at f7549d43; restored fork version and added 9 correctness regression tests inline adapted from upstream atomic-write, locking, frontmatter test files

### Pending Todos

3 pending (carried from v1.18):

- [HIGH] Dual-install Phase 2: update flow, hook awareness, and version-pinned suppression (tooling)
- [HIGH] Local patch archive: versioned history instead of single-snapshot overwrite (installer)
- [MEDIUM] Revisit provisional corpus grounding set (planning)

### Blockers/Concerns

- NPM_TOKEN config (pre-existing from v1.12, not blocking)
- Gitignore friction (pre-existing from v1.12, not blocking)
- Token count reliability in session-meta (109 input_tokens for 513-minute session is implausibly low) -- validation spike required before baselines committed in Phase 57

### Key Artifacts

- Audit evidence base: `.planning/audits/session-log-audit-2026-04-07/` (32 reports, 100 sessions, 165 findings)
- Research documents: `.planning/research/` (9 v1.20 research docs)
- Milestone steering brief: `.planning/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md`
