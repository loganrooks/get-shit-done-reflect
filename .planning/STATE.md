# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** The system never makes the same mistake twice -- signals capture what went wrong, spikes resolve uncertainty empirically, and the knowledge base surfaces relevant lessons before they're needed.
**Current focus:** v1.16 Signal Lifecycle & Reflection -- Phase 33 (Enhanced Reflector)

## Current Position

Phase: 33 of 35 (Enhanced Reflector)
Plan: 2 of 4 complete in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-28 -- Completed 33-01-PLAN.md (confidence-weighted detection rules)

Progress: [#####-----] 50% (Phase 33)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.13-v1.15 decisions archived in milestones/ directories.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v1.16 roadmap: 5 phases derived from 36 requirements across SCHEMA/SENSOR/REFLECT/LIFECYCLE/SPIKE categories
- v1.16 ordering: Schema first (foundation), then sensors, then reflector (highest value), then linkage (closes loop), spikes last (independent)
- Critical pitfall: Build reflector BEFORE adding more sensors -- reflector is the bottleneck, not detection
- P31-01: Four severity tiers (critical/notable/minor/trace) with tiered epistemic rigor
- P31-01: Lifecycle state machine: detected->triaged->remediated->verified + invalidated terminal
- P31-01: Mutability boundary: frozen detection payload + mutable lifecycle fields (agent-enforced)
- P31-01: signal_category authoritative over polarity; dismissed is triage decision, not lifecycle state
- P31-02: Moved single auto-fix/minor file differences/task order changes from trace to minor severity (now persisted to KB)
- P31-02: signal_category replaces polarity as primary positive/negative indicator; polarity retained for backward compatibility
- P31-02: Trace non-persistence enforcement deferred to Phase 32 synthesizer; documented explicitly
- P31-02: Anti-pattern 10.6 updated to detection-payload-frozen / lifecycle-fields-mutable boundary
- P31-03: Signal schema machine-enforceable via FRONTMATTER_SCHEMAS with conditional validation (critical requires evidence)
- P31-03: kb-rebuild-index.sh lifecycle_state column with "detected" default for existing signals
- P31-04: backward_compat keyed on lifecycle_state absence; evidence content validation for empty objects; Phase 33 triage constraint documented
- P32-01: Artifact sensor returns ALL candidates including trace -- synthesizer is single enforcement point for trace non-persistence
- P32-01: Log sensor ships disabled with spike question rather than being omitted -- documents the unknown (SENSOR-07)
- P32-01: Delimited sensor output format (## SENSOR OUTPUT / ## END SENSOR OUTPUT) with structured JSON
- P32-03: Synthesizer is sole KB writer; sensors never write directly to KB
- P32-03: Per-project cap not enforced (documented as future gap); per-phase cap of 10 is primary constraint
- P32-03: Post-write validation deletes malformed files rather than leaving broken state
- [Phase 32]: Git sensor uses expandable commit window (100 then 300) for fix-chain detection
- P32-04: Orchestrator passes file PATHS to sensors (not CONTENTS) to prevent context bloat
- P32-04: JSON extraction uses delimiter protocol (## SENSOR OUTPUT) with fenced code block fallback
- [Phase 33]: P33-02: SIG-format signals counted in separate Legacy row to prevent inflating Untriaged count
- [Phase 33]: P33-02: YOLO triage auto-approve limited to address and dismiss only; defer and investigate always prompt
- [Phase 33]: P33-02: Per-run triage cap of 10 signals to bound first-run bulk operations
- [Phase 33]: P33-02: Remediation suggestions are advisory; Phase 34 handles actual lifecycle transitions via resolves_signals
- [Phase 33]: P33-01: Weighted score thresholds 3.0/4.0/5.0 for critical/notable/minor replace raw count thresholds
- [Phase 33]: P33-01: Section 8 taxonomy declared authoritative; legacy categories mapped (debugging->testing, performance->architecture, other->workflow)
- [Phase 33]: P33-01: Counter-evidence bounded to 3 examples per pattern using index-first search; spike candidates triggered by investigate triage, low confidence, or marginal score

### Pending Todos

2 pending:
- [MEDIUM] Feature manifest system for declarative feature initialization (architecture)
- [HIGH] Dual-install Phase 2: update flow, hook awareness, and version-pinned suppression (tooling)

### Blockers/Concerns

- NPM_TOKEN config (pre-existing from v1.12, not blocking)
- Gitignore friction (pre-existing from v1.12, not blocking)
- 11 tech debt items from v1.15 audit (0 blockers) -- see milestones/v1.15-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md
- Nested YAML parsing risk: extractFrontmatter() may not handle deep nesting (triage.decision, evidence.supporting) -- test early in Phase 31

### Roadmap Evolution

v1.12 complete (Phases 0-6). v1.13 complete (Phases 7-12). v1.14 complete (Phases 13-21). v1.15 complete (Phases 22-30). All planned phases shipped. v1.16 roadmap created (Phases 31-35).

### Key Artifacts

- Tag `reflect-v1.12.2-pre-sync` -- immutable rollback point on main
- Tag `reflect-v1.13.0` -- annotated release tag on commit d6a250b
- Tag `reflect-v1.14.0` -- annotated release tag for multi-runtime interop
- Tag `reflect-v1.15.0` -- annotated release tag for backlog & update experience
- **Tag convention:** Fork tags use `reflect-v*` prefix to avoid collision with upstream tags. Upstream remote configured with `--no-tags`.
- PR #3 -- sync/v1.13-upstream to main (https://github.com/loganrooks/get-shit-done-reflect/pull/3)
- `.planning/FORK-STRATEGY.md` -- conflict resolution runbook + Merge Decision Log
- `.planning/FORK-DIVERGENCES.md` -- per-file merge stances, post-merge risk recalibration
