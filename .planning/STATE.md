# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Core value:** The system never makes the same mistake twice -- signals capture what went wrong, spikes resolve uncertainty empirically, and the knowledge base surfaces relevant lessons before they're needed.
**Current focus:** Phase 14 - Knowledge Base Migration

## Current Position

Phase: 14 of 17 (Knowledge Base Migration)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- Completed 14-02-PLAN.md (KB migration logic in installer)

Progress: v1.12 (25 plans) + v1.13 (18 plans) = 43 plans shipped | v1.14: [####......] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**v1.12 Final:**
- Total plans completed: 25
- Average duration: 2.8min
- Total execution time: 70min

**v1.13 Final:**
- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: ~4.4min
- Total execution time: ~70min

**v1.14 In Progress:**
- Plans completed: 4
- Duration: 25min (6min + 8min + 8min + 3min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.13 decisions archived in milestones/v1.13-ROADMAP.md.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Runtime-agnostic KB at ~/.gsd/knowledge/ (source files migrated in 14-01; installer migration in 14-02; COMPLETE)
- OpenAI Codex CLI as 4th runtime (pending -- drives Phase 15)
- Full continuity handoff across runtimes (pending -- drives Phase 16)
- Two-pass path replacement: KB paths to ~/.gsd/knowledge/ (Pass 1), runtime-specific paths to target (Pass 2)
- require.main guard added to install.js for testability
- Static capability matrix as reference doc (not config file) at get-shit-done/references/capability-matrix.md
- Feature detection via has_capability() prose pattern in orchestrators only (agent specs stay clean)
- Inform once then adapt silently strategy for degraded runtime behavior

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- NPM_TOKEN config (pre-existing from v1.12, not blocking)
- Gitignore friction (pre-existing from v1.12, not blocking)
- Phase 15 may need research-phase for Codex Skills conversion and AGENTS.md consolidation (flagged by research)

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 001 | Update installer branding for GSD Reflect | 2026-02-09 | c82ce23 | [001-update-installer-branding-for-gsd-reflect](./quick/001-update-installer-branding-for-gsd-reflect/) |

### Roadmap Evolution

v1.12 complete (Phases 0-6). v1.13 complete (Phases 7-12). v1.14 roadmap created (Phases 13-17).

### Key Artifacts

- Tag `v1.12.2-pre-sync` -- immutable rollback point on main
- Tag `v1.13.0` -- annotated release tag on commit d6a250b
- PR #3 -- sync/v1.13-upstream to main (https://github.com/loganrooks/get-shit-done-reflect/pull/3)
- `.planning/FORK-STRATEGY.md` -- conflict resolution runbook + Merge Decision Log
- `.planning/FORK-DIVERGENCES.md` -- per-file merge stances, post-merge risk recalibration
- `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` -- v1.14 multi-runtime interop research (HIGH confidence)
