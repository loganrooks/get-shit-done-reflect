# v1.13 Milestone Audit — Upstream Sync & Validation

**Audited:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** PASSED
**Milestone Goal:** Sync fork with upstream GSD (70 commits, v1.11.2→v1.18.0), selectively adopt bug fixes and evaluate architectural changes (gsd-tools), while exercising gsd-reflect's signal tracking and knowledge base in production to validate v1.12 features.

## Requirements Coverage

## E2E Flow Verification

**Score: 5/5 flows complete**

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Strategy → Merge → Release | Ph7 strategy → Ph8 conflict resolution → Ph12 tag v1.13.0 | COMPLETE |
| Merge → Architecture → Testing | Ph8 gsd-tools.js → Ph9 verification → Ph11 135 tests | COMPLETE |
| Thin Orchestrator Adoption | Ph8 3 commands → Ph9 2 more → Ph11 wiring validation | COMPLETE |
| Fork Identity Preservation | Ph7 divergence manifest → Ph8 merge → Ph9 zero upstream branding → Ph12 release | COMPLETE |
| Dogfooding → Knowledge Base → Lessons | Ph8-11 execution → Ph12 13 signals → 3 lessons → KB-COMPARISON | COMPLETE |

## Test Results

| Suite | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Fork vitest (wiring, KB, install) | 53 | All pass |
| Upstream gsd-tools.test.js | 75 | All pass |
| Fork gsd-tools-fork.test.js | 7 | All pass |
| **Total** | **135** | **All pass** |

## Tech Debt

**No critical tech debt accumulated during v1.13.**

Pre-existing tech debt from v1.12 (6 items documented in PROJECT.md) remains unchanged:
1. NPM_TOKEN config — not addressed (out of scope for sync milestone)
2. Gitignore friction — not addressed (out of scope)
3. Signal pipeline unexercised — **resolved** by v1.13 dogfooding (13 signals collected)
4. Command location inconsistency — **resolved** by thin orchestrator adoption
5. Milestone reflection unwired — **resolved** by v1.13 Phase 12 reflection
6. Knowledge surfacing unexercised in production — **resolved** by v1.13 dogfooding (3 lessons generated)

**Net tech debt reduction: 4 items resolved, 2 remaining (NPM_TOKEN, gitignore friction)**

## Version Consistency

| Location | Version | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| package.json | 1.13.0 | Correct |
| package-lock.json | 1.13.0 | Correct |
| get-shit-done/templates/config.json | 1.13.0 | Correct |
| CHANGELOG.md | v1.13.0 (2026-02-11) | Correct |
| git tag v1.13.0 | commit d6a250b | Correct |

## Release Readiness

- PR #3 open: sync/v1.13-upstream → main
- All 135 tests passing locally
- CI workflow structure validated
- Tag v1.13.0 created
- CHANGELOG documented
