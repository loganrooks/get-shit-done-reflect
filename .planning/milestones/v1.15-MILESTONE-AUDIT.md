## Cross-Phase Integration

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|
| Agent protocol reference | Phase 22 (agent-protocol.md) | 9 of 14 agents | WIRED (5 agents missing ref, see tech debt) |
| Manifest CLI commands | Phase 23 (gsd-tools.js) | Phase 24 workflows | WIRED |
| feature-manifest.json | Phase 23 (manifest file) | Phase 24 (apply-migration) | WIRED |
| Manifest installer verification | Phase 23 (install.js) | Phase 27 (safeFs) | WIRED |
| Backlog CRUD commands | Phase 25 (gsd-tools.js) | Phase 26 workflows | WIRED |
| Backlog milestone field | Phase 26 (promote --milestone) | new-milestone Step 9b | WIRED |
| Multi-status filter | Phase 26 (list --status) | complete-milestone backlog_review | WIRED |
| Todo metadata fields | Phase 25 (add-todo.md) | Phase 26 (check-todos promote) | WIRED |
| Restored agents | Phase 28 (3 agent specs) | Wiring tests (Phase 29) | WIRED |
| gsd-tools.js subcommands | Phases 23-26 | CLI router | ALL 8 GROUPS WIRED |
| Phase 30 workflow fixes | Phase 30 (source files) | Deployed workflows | STALE (needs re-install) |

**Score: 9/11 connections active (2 stale deployment)**

## E2E Flow Verification

| # | Flow | Phases | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | New project → manifest config | 23→24 | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Update → config gap detection | 23→24 | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Backlog capture → priority/source | 25 | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Milestone planning → backlog scoping | 25→26 | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Todo management → promote to backlog | 25→26 | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Quick task → complexity gate | 27 | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Phase execution → cleanup handoffs | 30 | STALE DEPLOY |
| 8 | Resume work → delete-after-load | 30 | STALE DEPLOY |
| 9 | Spike → research gate | 30 | STALE DEPLOY |
| 10 | Signal collection → KB storage | 28 | COMPLETE |
| 11 | Reflection → lesson distillation | 28 | COMPLETE |

**Score: 8/11 flows complete (3 architecturally complete in source, stale in deployed copy)**

**Note:** Flows 7-9 exist correctly in source. Running `node bin/install.js --claude --local` syncs all deployed files.

## Test Suite

| Suite | Tests | Pass | Fail |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| gsd-tools.test.js | 163 | 163 | 0 |
| install.test.js | 73 | 73 | 0 |
| wiring-validation.test.js | 20 | 20 | 0 |
| **Total** | **256** | **256** | **0** |

## Tech Debt Summary

### 11 items across 5 categories (0 blockers)

**Phase 22: Agent Protocol Gaps (2 items)**
- gsd-plan-checker.md missing `<required_reading>` agent-protocol.md reference
- gsd-research-synthesizer.md missing `<required_reading>` agent-protocol.md reference

**Phase 26: Human Verification Pending (4 items)**
- new-milestone backlog scoping (Step 1b) -- needs live run verification
- check-todos promote-to-backlog flow -- needs live run verification
- complete-milestone backlog review step -- needs live run verification
- Installed binary deployment verification

**Phase 27: Human Verification Pending (3 items)**
- Complexity gate classification accuracy -- needs live run verification
- Complex task routing to full planner flow -- needs live run verification
- safeFs error message visibility on permission errors -- needs live visual check

**Phase 28: Restoration Inconsistency (2 items)**
- 3 restored agents have inline protocol instead of shared agent-protocol.md reference (functional but inconsistent)
- reflect.md and spike.md commands only in .claude/commands/gsd/, not in source commands/gsd/ (missing from npm install path)

**Phase 29→30: Deployment Gap (1 item)**
- Installer ran at Phase 29 but Phase 30 committed after -- 4 deployed workflow files need re-sync (execute-phase.md, complete-milestone.md, resume-project.md, run-spike.md)

### Remediation Priority

1. **Quick fix:** Re-run installer to sync Phase 30 changes -- closes deployment gap and 3 stale E2E flows
2. **Quick fix:** Copy reflect.md and spike.md to source `commands/gsd/`
3. **Minor:** Add `<required_reading>` to gsd-plan-checker.md and gsd-research-synthesizer.md
4. **Minor:** Extract inline protocol from 3 restored agents to use shared agent-protocol.md
5. **Deferred:** Human verification items require live workflow runs -- track as backlog

## Anti-Patterns

No anti-patterns found in any v1.15 phase code. All modified files are substantive with no TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, or stub implementations.
