# Changelog

All notable changes to GSD Reflect will be documented in this file.

For upstream GSD changelog, see [GSD Changelog](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Shared `agent-protocol.md` extracted from 11 agent specs — single-edit propagation for all agents (Phase 22)
- Feature manifest system (`feature-manifest.json`) with typed config schemas, `manifest diff-config`, `manifest validate`, `manifest get-prompts` CLI commands (Phase 23)
- Manifest-driven config migration: `upgrade-project`, `new-project`, and `update` workflows consume manifest for config gap detection with lenient validation (Phase 24)
- Backlog system with two-tier storage (per-project + global `~/.gsd/backlog/`), Markdown+YAML items, 7 CLI subcommands (`add`, `list`, `group`, `update`, `promote`, `stats`, `index`) (Phase 25)
- Backlog workflow integration: milestone scoping in `/gsd:new-milestone`, todo promotion in `/gsd:check-todos`, backlog review in `/gsd:complete-milestone` (Phase 26)
- `/gsd:quick` complexity gate: trivial tasks execute inline, complex tasks use full planner+executor (Phase 27)
- `safeFs()` wrapper for installer file operations with descriptive error messages (Phase 27)
- Restored `/gsd:reflect`, `/gsd:spike`, `/gsd:collect-signals` commands and 3 agent specs deleted by f664984 (Phase 28)
- `.continue-here.md` lifecycle management: delete-after-load in resume, cleanup in execute-phase and complete-milestone (Phase 30)
- Spike research-first advisory gate with RESEARCH.md artifact existence check (Phase 30)

### Changed
- Fork tags migrated to `reflect-v*` namespace (e.g., `reflect-v1.15.0`) to avoid upstream tag collision
- Upstream remote configured with `--no-tags` to prevent tag re-import on fetch
- Release workflow and publish.yml updated to use `reflect-v*` tag prefix
- Test suite: 256 tests passing (163 gsd-tools + 73 install + 20 wiring)
- Shell scripts use portable constructs: `${GSD_HOME:-$HOME/.gsd}`, portable `mktemp`, `set -o pipefail` (Phase 27)
- `/gsd:resume-work` searches both `.planning/phases/*/` and `.planning/` for handoff files (Phase 30)

### Fixed
- Backlog stats test isolation via `GSD_HOME` env override (Phase 29)
- Wiring validation tests pass after restoring deleted agent specs (Phase 28-29)
- Installer binary redeployed to match source (875-line gap closed) (Phase 29)

## [1.14.2] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- `/gsd:release [patch|minor|major]` command for automated version bump, changelog, tag, and GitHub Release
- Release command registered in `/gsd:help` reference

### Fixed
- Removed 15 self-fulfilling tests (C7-C10 from PR #4 review): tests that tested Node.js stdlib instead of application code
- Rewrote `real-agent.test.js` as honest `.todo()` scaffold instead of fake-passing tests
- Made `/gsd:release` workflow project-agnostic (dynamic repo URL instead of hardcoded)

### Changed
- Test suite: 140 passing + 4 todo (down from 155 passing — honest count after removing inflated tests)

## [1.14.1] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- 4 runtimes supported: Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI
- Runtime-agnostic knowledge base at `~/.gsd/knowledge/` with backward-compatible symlink bridge
- Cross-runtime pause/resume with semantic handoff files and runtime detection
- Runtime capability matrix with `has_capability()` pattern for graceful degradation
- OpenAI Codex CLI support: Skills format, AGENTS.md, MCP config.toml generation
- Signal provenance fields (runtime, model, gsd_version) in all KB entry types
- Gemini/Codex format converters for agent body text and MCP configuration
- KB management scripts copied to `~/.gsd/bin/` for runtime-agnostic access
- Pre-migration backup before KB migration with integrity verification
- Capability guards on collect-signals, reflect, and run-spike workflows
- Spike workflow enhanced with feasibility section and research-first advisory gate
- 54 new tests for multi-runtime support (155 total)

### Changed
- Knowledge base migrated from legacy per-runtime location to `~/.gsd/knowledge/`
- Installer uses two-pass path replacement (KB paths → shared, runtime paths → per-runtime)
- Signal command context reduced 7.6x (888 → 116 lines) with self-contained pattern
- Signal cap changed from per-phase/10 to per-project/100
- `convertClaudeToCodexSkill()` uses dynamic regex for absolute path support

### Fixed
- migrateKB: backup collision check (appends timestamp if `.migration-backup` exists)
- migrateKB: dangling symlink detection and cleanup via `lstatSync`
- Codex `@` file reference regex now handles absolute paths in global installs

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Synced with upstream GSD v1.18.0 (70 commits merged from v1.11.2)
- Adopted upstream features: --auto mode, --include flag, reapply-patches, JSONC config parsing, update detection (global vs local), parallel research, new-milestone config persistence
- Adopted thin orchestrator pattern (commands delegate to workflow files)
- Adopted gsd-tools.js CLI for commits, config, state management
- Signal tracking validated through production use (13 signals collected, 3 lessons generated from v1.13 milestone)
- KB comparison document: file-based knowledge base vs upstream's reverted MCP Memory approach

### Changed
- 6 commands converted to thin orchestrator pattern (new-project, help, update, signal, upgrade-project, community)
- Fork divergences now tracked explicitly in FORK-DIVERGENCES.md with per-file merge stances
- Config template updated with v1.13.0 version default
- CI/CD workflows updated with upstream and fork test steps

### Fixed
- Adopted 11 upstream bug fixes including:
  - Executor verification improvements (prevent false completions)
  - Context fidelity enforcement (accurate file references)
  - API key prevention in committed code
  - Commit docs config flag support
  - Auto-create config directory on first run
  - Statusline crash prevention
  - Subagent type configuration
- Test suite repaired after architectural migration (135 total tests: 53 vitest + 75 upstream + 7 fork)

## [1.12.2] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Publish workflow switched to npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — removes NPM_TOKEN dependency
- Removed `registry-url` from setup-node to allow native OIDC auth (was forcing token-based auth)

## [1.12.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- GitHub repository URLs corrected from `rookslog` to `loganrooks` in package.json, README, update command, and publish workflow
- CI lint job removed (unused, caused workflow parse failures)
- Wiring validation test allowlists upstream GSD agents installed at runtime

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- `/gsd:health-check` command for workspace validation (KB integrity, config validity, stale artifacts)
- `/gsd:upgrade-project` command for seamless version migration with mini-onboarding
- DevOps context capture during `/gsd:new-project` initialization
- DevOps Gaps detection in codebase mapping
- Version tracking via `gsd_reflect_version` in config.json

- Fork-specific README.md and CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- Config template updated with health_check and devops sections
- Help command updated with new commands
